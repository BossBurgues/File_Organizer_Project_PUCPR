üñ•Ô∏è File Organizer v3.0
File Organizer is a full-stack web application built to manage and organize local files efficiently and intuitively. The interface is built with React and the backend with FastAPI (Python), running on a local server.

‚ú® Features
File Navigation: Explore your file system with a directory tree, a detailed file table, and a button to go to the parent directory.
